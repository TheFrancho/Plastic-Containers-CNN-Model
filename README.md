# Plastic-Containers-CNN-Model

Convolutional Neural Network algorithm for integrity detection on plastic containers.

This is the source code developed [for this paper](https://repositorio.utp.edu.co/server/api/core/bitstreams/4d921d2f-286a-4881-ab18-428988fa4583/content) (on Spanish).

You can also find the dataset used for training and the Jupyter Notebook [in my Kaggle repo](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sebastianfrancogomez/tarros-dataset-final-for-real).
